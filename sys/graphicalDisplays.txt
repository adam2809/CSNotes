>>Cathode ray tubes(CRT)
-Everything in a vaccum
-Cathode generates electrons
-focus and accelerating anodes direct and speed up the electrons
-you can deflect electrons to make them hit different parts of the phosphorous screen and by that
creating a dot of light
-if you generate electrons quickly enough you can create an illusion of a whole image but if you freeze
time and look at a CRT you would only see a single dot of light
-how to draw mushrooms oscilloscope
-they can be vector(you just draw shapes with a dot) or raster(start usually at the top left corner and draw
lines one by one)

>>Resolution
-Nyquist theorem TODO
-aliasing can appear if display is viewed from up close or if the resolution is too small

>>Video memory:
-CPU desnt take care of diplaying pixels as it would not have time to do actual calculations
instead a dedicated piece of hardware displays pixels an array of pixels stored in memory. To
control the display CPU alters that pixel array. The issue is that you can't have display hardware
and CPU accessing that memory at the same time. Solutions:
  #Dedicated video memory - only acessed by the video hardware or accessed by CPU only when video hardware is
  bound not to access it(eg. when screen is blank)
  #Dual access RAM - memory that can be accessed by two things at the same time

>>Drawing into memory TODO review slide
