>>C program always starts with main() just as java

>>ANSI C comments look like this:

code;
/*comments
still comments
comments comments comments
end of comments*/
code;

>>Function definitions:

returntype functionname(parameters){
  code;
}

>>Function declaration:

Since it is necessary to tell the compiler a function exists before calling it which is not always
possible function DECLARATIONS (not definitions) are used. They look like this:
returntype functionname(parameters);

>>Calling functions:

functionname(agrgument1, agrgument2, ...)

>>Standard libraries/importing:
-#include <lib.h> or #include "lib.h"
-Library names end with '.h' like this '<clib.h>'(look in system libraries) or '"clib.h"'(look in current directory
than system libraries)

>>Variables are representations of memory locations

>>C data types:
-char(8-bit)
-int(32-bit)
-float(32-bit)
-double(64-bit)
-bit sizes dependent on compiler(can be checked with sizeof())

>>C qualifiers:
-used in conjunction with types
-signed or unsigned
-short or long

>>Variable declaration:
-[qualifier] type name;

>>Watch out for reserved words (https://beginnersbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/C-keywords.png)

>>Value of a declared variable that was not assigned is indeterminate

>>Constants also have types:
-3 is an int
-3.0 is a double
-3L is long int
-3UL is unsigned long int

>>Storage classes:
-automatic;local to block of code;is destroyed at the end of the block
-static;kinda like global variable in python or java;declared inside block with keyword static
or outside block(no need to put static in in that case)
-block of code only sees local variable if there is a global one with the same name

>>It is good practice to return 0; in main at the end because this means the program exited without errors
if main returns anything else it means it exited with an errors

>>"\b" in printf is a backspace

>>Execution of two statements at the end of for is possible


>>Strings
-are coded like this: char[] = "string\0"
                       /\              ^---NUL character always needed as C stops string only when it sees NUL char
                       ||
no builtin string it is an array of chars

-name of an array is also a pointer to the first adress of the array
but they are constant so it is not possible to reassign them
-char texta[] = "hello world" => constant
-char *textp = "hello world"  => can be changed
-Counting string length using pointer arithmetic:
             |-------------------|
             |int i = 0;         |
             |char *a="some str";|
             |while(a != '\0'){  |
             |  a++;             |
             |  i++;             |
             |}                  |
             |-------------------|

>>scanf
-scanf("%s %d",name, &age)
          /\    ^------^--------it takes pointers not variables unlike printf
          ||
looks for string than space than int
-kind of works like regex
-also returns the number of chars sucessfully loaded

Arrays:
-No bounds checking in arrays so for int a[10];printf(a[12]); compiles and runs but the behavior is unexpected it
will display whatever was in the memory adress it pointed to;This is called buffer overflow
-int *pa = &a[0]; is equievelant to int *pa = a; as a is a pointer to the first element of the array
-passing into functions double fun(double arr[]); is the same as double fun(double *arr);
-no length function so length checking has to be done manually
-copying:
  int[] a={1,2},b[2];
  b = a; - this only performs a shallow copy(sets b to point to the start of a)
  a[1]=0; - this changes both a[1] and b[1] as a and b both point to the same adress
  #deep copy has to be performed by explicitly setting b[i] = a[i] for every i less than the size of the arrays
-2D arrays:
  #when passing into a function you need to supply length of the last braces so void fun(int arr[][3]); and fun(int arr[2][3]); are OK
  but fun(int arr[][]); doesn't compile


>>Pointer arithmetic
int a[]={1,2,3};
int *p = a; - p now points to the first element of a
p = p + 1; - now p points to the second element of a as adding one to a array pointer tells it to point
to the next object not to the next byte

>>Dynamic memory allocation:
-array size is set at compile time so you cant do scanf("%d",&x);int a[x]; C doesn't allow for variable
array size declarations
-Program Memory layout lecture 14 slide TODO figure this out
-declaring variables inside functions is declaring on the stack
-declaring using malloc is declaring on the heap
-void *malloc(size)
  #lives in stdlib.h
  #returns a void pointer(it doesn't say anything about how many bytes one objects occupies so integer arithmetic is not possible
  (it has to be casted to enable it)) to the beginning adress of the allocated memory
  #to allocate space for n elements of type t call malloc(n * sizeof(t)) or use calloc(numberOfObjects,sizeOfEach)(it also zeroes the bytes allocated)
  #it is good to check if malloc returned NULL it does it when the heap is full
-void free(void *ptr) - pass pointer that malloc returned to free the memory
-void* realloc(initialPointer,newSize);takes initialPointer and reallocates all data which it points to to a new adress with size newSize

>>Casting:
-for varibales
double pi = 3.14;
int piint = (int) pi;
-for pointers
int *p = (int*) malloc(4*sizeof(int)); - allocates memory for 4 ints with start at p
-works pretty much just like java

>>Libraries:
-divided into .h(header) files(declarations) and .c(logic)
-to only compile code if _DEF is defined:
#ifndef _DEF

sth;
sth;
sth;
sth;
sth;

 #endif

>>Make/Makefile:
-the format for a makefile is:
target:prerequisite
  recipie
-TODO learn how to use make/makefiles linking and object code

>>Custom data types:
-typedef is the keywor
-aliases:
  #typedef double Decimal; - this works exactly as aliases in .bashrc so after wriring it
  it is possible to say Decimal a; and it will be the same as double a;
  #they have a scope just as vaiables
-struct:
  #Syntax for creating them:
  struct name{
    type varname; -|
    type varname;  |\
    type varname;  |/   members
    type varname; -|
  };
  #Syntax for declaring:
  struct structname name;
  #Syntax for initializing
  structname name = {val,val,val,...,val};
  #To avoid writing struct at the beginning of declarations and initializations type aliases come in handy:
  typedef struct name{
    type varname;
    type varname;
    type varname;
    ...ctions:
-Example:
int fun(int x){
  int a,b,c;
  if(x&&a){
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
int main(){
  a=fun; - here a is assigned a pointer to the fun function
}
-template for pointer to function types: returntype (*)(arg1type,arg2type,...)
-to write a function that takes a pointer to a function as an argument declare:
returntype funname(returntype (*nametouseinsidefunction)(arg1type,arg2type,...));

>>C file I/O:
-everything is a file(e.g keyboard, monitor, usb ports, sockets). This way there is a unified way to do I/O.
-to open: open(path,mode(read/write/append)); return a file descriptor
-to read: read(fileDescriptor,pointerToAllocatedMemory, byteCount); puts raw bytes from the file in
memory pointed to by pointerToAllocatedMemory
-to close: close(fileDescriptor);
  } name;
  name structvarname; - now writing struct at the beginning is not necessary
  #to get a variable from a struct structvarname.desiredvariable
  #struct arrays are declared the same way normal arrays are
  #common programming pattern:
  structname *varname;
  *(varname).sth;
  varname->sth;
  /*two lines above do the same thing*/
  #usually only a pointer to a struct is passed to a function as passing the whole thing would be inefficient with
  bigger structs
  #a struct with a char and an int is not actually 5 bytes long as int can only start at adresses divisible by 4 so
  such a struct would look like this:
  char takes up the first byte(byte 0)
  than from byte 1 to byte 3 C puts padding
  int starts at byte 4 and ends at byte 7

>>Void pointers:
-point to a memory location without a known type
-pointer arithmetic is an error with void pointers to do it a cast is necessary
-for the linked list library store a void pointer in a struct and the user of the library will have
to perform the casts

>>Pointers to functions:
-Example:
int fun(int x){
  int a,b,c;
  if(x&&a){
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;
}
int main(){
  a=fun; - here a is assigned a pointer to the fun function
}
-template for pointer to function types: returntype (*)(arg1type,arg2type,...)
-to write a function that takes a pointer to a function as an argument declare:
returntype funname(returntype (*nametouseinsidefunction)(arg1type,arg2type,...));

>>C file I/O:
-everything is a file(e.g keyboard, monitor, usb ports, sockets). This way there is a unified way to do I/O.
-to open: open(path,mode(read/write/append)); return a file descriptor
-to read: read(fileDescriptor,pointerToAllocatedMemory, byteCount); puts raw bytes from the file in
memory pointed to by pointerToAllocatedMemory
-to close: close(fileDescriptor);
OR:
-to open: fopen(char* path,char* mode) returns pointer to a file or NULL if the filename is nonexistant
-modes:
 #r read
 #r+ read and write
 #w if exist erase it if it doesnt exist create new and write
 #w+ if exist erase it if it doesnt exist create new and write/read
 #a if exists write(append) to it if it doesnt exist create new and write(append)
 #a+ if exists write(append)/read to it if it doesnt exist create new and write(append)/read
-C uses buffers as writing to files is significantly more expensive than writing to buffer in memory so to actually
write to a file call fclose(pointertofile) or fflush(pointertofile)
-writing to files: fprintf(pointertofile,format,stufftoputin%sor%d,stufftoputin%sor%d,stufftoputin%sor%d,...)
-stderr,stdout,stdin are pointers to files
-to redirect program outputs in terminal ./prog > stdoutoutput or ./prog 2> stderroutput (> for stdout
2> for stderr &> for both)
-reading from files: fscanf(pointertofile,format,pointerstostorein) returns EOF(end of file) as the last char in a file
or fchar(pointertofile) to read one character
-TODO look up reading in detail
-writing:
  #fscanf is unsafe as it doesnt limit the amount of chars fetched
  #fgets reads a string from a file and has a parameter to specify maxchars to read:
  fgets(pointertogetinto,maxchars,pointertofile);
-seeking:
  #fscanf and fgets use sequential access so to read the n-th char you have to read all chars from 0 to n-1
  this uses random access
  #fseek(pointertofile,whichchar,relativetowhat)
  #relativetowhat: SEEK_SET - relative to the begginning of the file SEEK_CURR - relative to the current position
  SEEK_END - relatife to the end of the file

>>Call stack:
-functions are put there when they are called and popped when they return
-each entry is a stack frame(or activaion record) which contains passed parameters return value local variables etc.

>>Tail recursion ; last instruction in a function is a call to itself ; makes it easier for the compiler to optimize the code
as it doesn't have to bother with copying local variables so much

>>Compilation
-cross-compiling: compiling for an architecture different from the one compiled on(godbolt.org - interactive compiler)
-stages:
  #preprocessing(0)
  #compialtion()(1)
  #assembly(assembly to machine code)(2)
  #linking(3)
-0: (-E flag in gcc)
  #parses all lines starting with # and removes them
  #removes all comments
  #remembrers where file comes from
  #replaces macros with their contents, does the preprocessor directives thing
  #doesnt check for errors
-1: (-S flag in gcc):
  #from C to assembly
-2: (- flag in gcc):
  #from assembly to object code
-3 (-o flag in gcc):
  #organises object code

>>Preprocessor directives:
-#DEFINE NAME TEXT - does a search and replace on all NAME and replaces with TEXT in the source file
-can also be used with arguments: #DEFINE square(a) a * a; int x = square(2) <-- gets replaced with int x = 2 * 2 in the preprocessing stage
USE BRACKETS AROUND VARIABLES AND EXPRESSIONS USING THIS METHOD NO TIME TO EXPLAIN JUST DO
-using #ifdef for debugging - you can surround debugging printfs with it like this to print debug messages only for debugging:
int a = 5;
#ifdef DEBUG
printf("%d debug msg\n",a);
#endif
return a;
-the debug message will be printed only if compiled like this: gcc -DDEBUG flags progname
-#ifdef also useful for handling different directory separators

>>Variable length arguments
-stdarg.h has 3 macros and a data type for handling this type of shit
-to define: type fun(type arg0,type arg1, ...)
-you have to declare va_list ap; in your function
-va_start(ap,last normal argument) - do this when you want to start
-va_arg(ap,type) - to access next argument
-va_end(ap) - call this when you want to stop using the variable length args and free resources

>>goto
-DON'T USE THIS GARBAGE
-DON'T USE THIS GARBAGE
-DON'T USE THIS GARBAGE
-goto LABEL; - goes to the line where LABEL: is

>>Assertions
-it is a macro in assert.h
-if conditon in parentheses is false program exits and prints error message
-use only for debugging they shouldnt affect code behaviour
-to remove them use -NDEBUG flag

>>enum
-used to create groups of related constants
-to use: enum NAME{ENUMERATOR,ENUMERATOR,ENUMERATOR, ...}
-asocciates the n-th ENUMERATOR with n
-it's just like saying:
#define ENUMERATOR 0
#define ENUMERATOR 2
#define ENUMERATOR 1
...
-or to set custom values: enum NAME{ENUMERATOR=VAL,ENUMERATOR=VAL,ENUMERATOR=VAL, ...}
-if you don't set one of ENUMERATOR values it will use the value of the previous one plus 1

>>union
-the same syntax as struct just put in union instead of struct
-the difference is that a union only stores one type at a time

>>const type varname; - declares that the value of this variable wont change

>>register type varname; - tells the compiler to try to store the variable in a register
