>>Sum-of-products:
-Define a truth table with desired outputs
-Cross out all lines that have 0 as a desired value
-If the row of the table is: A=1 B=0 C=1 you convert it to A & ~B & C;do that for every row
-Put all of the formulas created in the previous step and put them in an OR function
-The produced formula is bound to be correct although it is not always the simplest one
TODO look up a proof for Sum-of-products

>>Boolean algebra:
-Used to simplify created by sum-of-products and to analyze logical formulas
